# TODO

## General

- allow for repo-specific .producer file

- for `release` version, against previous major/minor/bugfix version numbers

- for `release`, send notifications

- for `release`, only check docblocks for beta, RC, and stable releases?

- separate `preflight` and `release` commands, each to take a version number?


## New Commands

Cf. existing aura bin commands at <https://github.com/auraphp/bin/tree/master/src/Command>.

```
producer docs
    checks the php docblocks, including @package tags

producer versions
    lists existing release versions

producer log-since-release [$version]

producer preflight $version
    checks that a release would be valid

producer release $version
    checks that a release would be valid
    actually does the release (bitbucket is just a tag)
```
