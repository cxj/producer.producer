# TODO

## General

- allow for repo-specific .producer file

- for `release` version, against previous major/minor/bugfix version numbers

- for `release`, send notifications

## New Commands

Cf. existing aura bin commands at <https://github.com/auraphp/bin/tree/master/src/Command>.

producer log-since <$version>

producer release [ <$branch> ]
    switches to $branch if specified
    checks that a release would be valid

    switches to $branch, which must be specified
    checks that a release would be valid

```
