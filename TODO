# TODO

## General

- allow for repo-specific .producer file

- for `validate` version, against previous major/minor/bugfix version numbers

- for `release`, send notifications

Cf. existing aura bin commands at <https://github.com/auraphp/bin/tree/master/src/Command>.

```

    checks the php docblocks, including @package tags
